Responsibilities was shared amongst the team with each person taking on the bulk of each respective section. Greg took on the task of Admin functions while Eric and Derrick worked on the Reservation/Browsing/Customer Representative functionalities. The group all worked on debugging and putting the final project together, and Greg worked to capture the video recording for the demo.

Bugs:
It took many days to complete this project and we managed to accomplish all, but one functionality on the checklist, that is the Customer Representative reply to customers functionality. This may have stemmed from initial design of the database as we had a hard time figuring out how exactly to save the response and display it alongside the customer message. In addition, we had a bug where the customer message that is sent is duplicated in the individual message thread of both the customer and customer representative as a reply.
